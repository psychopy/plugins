About PsychoPy Plugins
=====================================

History
----------

Up until PsychoPy version 2023.1.x PsychoPy was a single, increasingly large package, that tried to supply all the things a scientist might need. That began to get unwieldy as the number of components grew, each bringin its own dependencies, not all of which would be avaiable everywhere.


Why Plugins?
-------------

Moving to a plugin system brings several advantages:

- users can find the features they need more easily without being overwhelmed by all the things they don't personally use
- contributors can add new features with a greater degree of independence on the core PsychoPy team


Installing plugins
---------------------

You can install plugins using the `>tools>plugins` menu item in the PsychoPy application.
